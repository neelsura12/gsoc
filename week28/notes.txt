Goals

Do SBC on normal MLE
Plan out API 
Figure out why MLE doesn't work for t-dist / exponential
Draft blog post with Normal MLE with SBC

Progress

t-dist and exponential MLE don't return correct inference even if we fix loc, scale, df parameters (only infer delta)
The t-dist inference is good when nu is higher (as nu gets larger, t- becomes more normal)
