# Goals

Done -
Do SBC on normal MLE
Figure out why MLE doesn't work for t-dist / exponential
Compare math against what's being implemented
Look at LambertW::Gaussianize, where is mean/var coming from for cauchy 1

# Progress

t-dist and exponential MLE don't return correct inference even if we fix loc, scale, df parameters (only infer delta)
The t-dist inference is good when nu is higher (as nu gets larger, t- becomes more normal).

Exponential distribution seems to struggle as well, possible due to x negative or close to 0.

## Summary of SBC

I wrote two Stan programs, one that infers delta (heavy-tailed parameter) given fixed mu/sigma and another that infers
(delta, mu, sigma) simultaneously. 

The priors are delta ~ Exp(1), mu ~ normal(0, 1) and, sigma ~ invgamma(10, 10).

I ran the SBC as follows, for each Stan program
1. Generate (delta, mu, sigma) from priors
2. Each prior draw creates a single SBC iteration
For each SBC iteration,
3. Generate symmetric heavy-tailed samples (type h) using the R package
4. Run the Stan sampler, which generates 4000 samples from posterior (4 chains x 1000 iter_sampling)
5. Compare the prior draw vs. the 4000 posterior samples per parameter
At the end of all SBC iterations
6. Make a histogram of prior rank
7. Store these as images in gsoc/week28/results

sbc_delta_joint, sbc_mu_joint, sbc_sigma_joint are SBC ranks from the Stan program estimating (delta, mu, sigma)
sbc_delta is the SBC rank from the Stan program from estimating delta only
