# Goals

Plan out API (design doc)
Draft blog post with Normal/Exponential with SBC 
Figure out use-cases for LambertW x Exp (Exponential-ize Weibull? see below)

# Progress

# Meeting notes 

- Student-t nu/delta both heavy-tailed parameters, can't be identified
- Exponential/Normal, how does Gaussianize
  - Support the different modes (Delta_l, Delta_r)
- Gaussianize, x is in the model block, is it generated quantities 
- Tweedie distribution (check the forums)
  - Power is hard to estimate 
  - 1 < p < 2
- Neel to send design document
- Lambert_exponential_transform,untransform
- Offset multiplier for center/rescaling 
  - https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/updated-non-centered-parametrization-with-offset-and-multiplier/13601
- Adding constraints, Stan samples from unconstrained space, new functionality that will require _constrain, _free function, need to make a bijection, would do backend this way. Add jacobian keyword this way.

- Jacobian adjustemnt - Lemma A.2 (supplement) vs. g_Y(y | beta, \delta)
